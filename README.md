🏏 ESPN Cricket Data Analysis – Real-Time Stats Dashboard & Report

📌 Project Overview
This project analyses cricket player performance across **Batting**, **Bowling**, and **Fielding** metrics using real-time data from ESPN Cricinfo.  
The goal was twofold:
1. **Interactive Dashboard** – Built in Power BI for real-time exploration of player performance.
2. **Detailed Analytical Report** – Presenting career highlights and statistics in a structured and visually engaging manner.

This project solves that problem by:
- Collecting **real-time player data** from ESPN Cricinfo
- Structuring it for analysis in Power BI
- Producing both **dashboards** and **PDF reports** for ease of use
